# Manufacturer name
### Application to become an approved third party manufacturer as per [HIP19](https://github.com/helium/HIP/blob/master/0019-third-party-manufacturers.md)
Cambium Networks
## Summary
I'm authorized to sell cambium hardware in Brazil and all of Latin America to the private sector. I have a company that does free public wifi instalations in a a few of cities in Brazil and Portugal. I'm interested in buying thousands of this product https://www.cambiumnetworks.com/products/iiot/n500-900-mhz/ but they need to be approved by you guys. I'm interested in "building" full gateways. 

## Company Information (required)

* What is your company name? Power-Fi (www.powerfi.io)
* How long have you been in business? 3 Years 
* What kind of products have you created? We are a saas/telco company.
* How many have you sold? Cambium has sold tens(hundreds?) of thousands of devices.
* What brought you to Helium etc? I'm fully devoted to making smart cities a reality. Helium seems like a formidable way to reach such goal. 

## Product Information (required)

Your time to shine! What are you building? Whatâ€™s so great about it? 
* What is your approximate price point? USD 500-550
* 
* Detailed hardware designs, including relevant parts
* Evidence of a functioning prototype - photos, videos. Renderings are OK but physical prototypes are much, much better.
* We don't have any at the moment. We would be using the 
* 
* Your plan for software setup and configuration for the devices. This would presumably include remote updates and the ability for hosts to change wifi settings, via Helium's official app or otherwise.
* We're still looking into it. 
* What is your expected production and delivery timeline?
* We have loads of devices ready to be shipped to Brasil/Worldwide.
Photos and videos welcome.

## Previous shipments (required)

Startups welcome! Answer No if that's the answer.
* Have you shipped anything in the past?
* We haven't shipped anything, we are trying to get cambium to become our hardware provider.
* Which countries have you previously shipped regulatory FCC or CE approved products? 
* Cambium has shipped around the world.
* Which countries do you plan to ship to?
* Brazil initially, then all of S.A and finally in all countries compatible with 915. 

## Customer Support (required)

* How will your customers be able to contact you for support for your products?
* Website bot and email if required.
* For how long? How are you planning to handle repairs and replacements?
* Depends on cambium. As long as they make those units, we plan on buying/selling them as well as providing customer support.

## Hardware Security Element (required)

The community is concerned about devices that can be easily hacked, specifically by copying their `swarm_key` files. Applications should include plan for how the devices will be secured, potentially including:

* Encrypted/locked-down firmware
* Encrypted storage of the miner swarm_key, either via disk encryption or hardware measures like an ECC chip
* Encrypted buses, potting and other anti-tampering measures.
* Willingness to submit a prototype for audit, and sharing those audit results publicly (pass or fail)


## Hardware Information (required)

Please let us know:
* Which security (swarm) element are you using?
* We didn't get to that stage yet.
* Which LoRa chipset are you planning to use in your gateway (ie SX1302/03 & SX1250s or SX1301/08 & SX1255/57)
* I'm not sure. I'll have to ask Cambium engineers.
* We recommend you don't use the SX1301 in new designs
* Where are you sourcing your components from? All components are in Canada.
* How many radio modules/ concentrators can you procure? Thousands.

## Manufacturing Information (required)

* Have you built and delivered radio hardware products before?
* Cambium has. 
* Have you built gateways before?
* Cambium has.
* How many gateways did you make? 
* Thousands.
* If you have not built gateways before, are you using a third party manufacturer?
* Yes, Cambium.
This is the single largest risk with most hardware ventures. If possible please provide information about your manufacturing partners and supply chain.

## Proof of Identity

Per typical KYC/AML procedures, proof of identity for major shareholders (25%+ ownership) will be expected to be provided privately to representatives from Helium Inc or DeWi board members. This will be attested and publicly confirmed by those representatives, e.g. as GitHub comments. 
* Contact details for this will be provided after your application is submitted on GitHub.

## Budget & Capital (required)

* How many of these are you hoping to make and sell?
* Thousands. 
* How much money will be required up-front? 200K USD.
* How much money do you have on-hand, and how much do you have access to? What is your plan for additional financing if required? This is the second biggest risk in new hardware ventures -- getting almost over the line and then running out of cash.
* I have 200K on-hand but I can get 1-5M USD depending on how well this works.

## Risks & Challenges (required)

Please tell us about some of the challenges that would prevent these products from becoming a reality, and how you might address them.

Importation taxes are a bit high in Brazil, but that won't stop motivated miners. Shipping time could increase depending on global issues. Also, I'm not sure if Cambium has hardware compatible with what Helium requires. I'm very close with their directors so that's an advantage I have. My intial plan will be to buy a few batches for the first 1-2 semesters and then start selling them locally and then abroad.
